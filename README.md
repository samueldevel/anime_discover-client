## How do project will be?

> I thinked in a authenticated project which there is a list of anime, and each anime has a only page containing metadatas about it-self, The user will can also both comment and share the anime.

My idea is improve java + backend base, and too learn typescript, understanding base concepts and what there is under the backend cloth before continue improving advanced concepts as: microservices, webflux, spring boot...
